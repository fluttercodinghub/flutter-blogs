When building Flutter applications, choosing the right project structure is crucial for maintainability and scalability. Let's explore two popular approaches: feature-based and layer-based architecture.

## Quick Overview

### Layer-Based Architecture
```
lib/
  ├── api/              // API client, endpoints
  ├── blocs/            // Business Logic Components
  ├── models/           // Data models
  ├── repositories/     // Data sources
  ├── utils/            // Helper functions
  ├── screens/          // UI screens
  ├── widgets/          // Reusable UI components
  └── main.dart         // Entry point
```

### Feature-Based Architecture
```
lib/
  ├── core/             // Shared functionality
  │   ├── network/      
  │   ├── widgets/      
  │   └── utils/        
  ├── features/         // Feature modules
  │   ├── authentication/
  │   │   ├── data/     
  │   │   ├── domain/   
  │   │   └── presentation/
  │   ├── home/
  │   └── settings/
  └── main.dart
```

## Key Differences

**Layer-Based:**
- Familiar MVC/MVVM pattern
- Good for small projects
- Feature code spread across directories
- Harder to scale

**Feature-Based:**
- Better for large projects
- Improved team collaboration
- Easy feature isolation
- Initial setup complexity
